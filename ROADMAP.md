## Dependencies & Risks

### External Dependencies
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 13+ required
- **Python**: 3.9+ for latest features
- **Docker**: For containerized deployment
- **Redis**: For caching and session management

### Technical Risks
- **Scalability**: Large portfolios (1000+ projects) need architecture review
- **Data Migration**: Existing project data import challenges
- **Integration Complexity**: Third-party API rate limits and changes
- **Performance**: Real-time calculations for large datasets

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement horizontal scaling with load balancers
- Develop robust data migration tools and validation
- Build resilient integration layer with fallbacks
- Optimize database queries and implement smart caching
